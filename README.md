# What are NFBs?

NFBs are Non-Fungible Boosters, which are packs that contain one or more NFTs that are obtained when opened (also known as burned). This repository includes all the necessary materials for conducting an NFB drop.

## Contracts

The contracts in this repository draw inspiration from the requirements of the Polychain Monsters project, but they can be adapted to work for a range of other use cases as well.
